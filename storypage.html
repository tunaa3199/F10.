  <h2>Raj</h2>
  <h3>
    In a small village, a boy named Raj faced financial hardships that threatened his dream of becoming a doctor. Undeterred, he took on odd jobs to save money for his education. His hard work caught the attention of a local doctor, who offered him a part-time job. Raj's persistence paid off when he secured a scholarship for medical school. After graduating, he returned to his village to open a free clinic, inspiring others with his dedication and perseverance.
