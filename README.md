Description of the functionalities of the application
- These fuctions includes:
  1) When one enters the home page, he or she will be able to choose his or her mood. Depending on his or her choice, he or she will be brought to two possible page. If one choose the "happy" emoji, one will be brought to a page that allows him or her to read others' stories or share his or her story. If one is "not happy" emoji, one will be brought to a page that allows him or her to read a written message or read others' stories.
  2) The written message: We wrote a message for those people who chose that they are not feeling happy. This message is meant to comfort them as they feel down. We have designed the message such that it is placed in an envelope and visitors of the website gets to open the envelope by clicking different buttons.
  3) The star jar: The star jar is filled with stories shared by other people. Visitors of this website get to share their experience in life as well as their hopes and encouragement through paper stars in an anonymous way. Their actual names are not shown in the website.
  4) Controlling the message: Admins (ie people who are running the application) are also able to delete messages that they deem as inappropriate from the star jar. This helps to protect the viewers of this website.
